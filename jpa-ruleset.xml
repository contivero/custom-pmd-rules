   <description>
      Eager fetching is discouraged in the &quot;Java Persistence with
      Hibernate&quot; book, as well as by Vlad Mihalcea, one of the
      top Hibernate commiters as well as author of &quot;High-Performance
      Java Persistence&quot;. See https://vladmihalcea.com/eager-fetching-is-a-code-smell/

      @ManyToOne and @OneToOne are EAGER by default, so one should
      explicitly use fetch = FetchType.LAZY with them.
