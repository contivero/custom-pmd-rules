   <description>
      Eager fetching is discouraged in the &quot;Java Persistence with
      Hibernate&quot; book, as well as by Vlad Mihalcea, one of the
      top Hibernate commiters as well as author of &quot;High-Performance
      Java Persistence&quot;. See https://vladmihalcea.com/eager-fetching-is-a-code-smell/

      @ManyToOne and @OneToOne are EAGER by default, so one should
      explicitly use fetch = FetchType.LAZY with them.

<rule name="Do_not_declare_entities_final"

      message="Don't declare a JPA entity as final"
      class="net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.rule.XPathRule">
   <description>
      Among the requirements defined in the JPA 2.1 specification
      for an entity class, one of them is that the class not be
      final. So from a portability point of view, it&apos;s not good.Additionally,
      Hibernate in particular relies on subclassing to generate
      proxies to be able to lazy-load the entity. Setting the entity
      to final will prevent Hibernate from doing so.
